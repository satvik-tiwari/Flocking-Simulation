## Demo
Click [here](https://editor.p5js.org/Kivtas/full/Mmt31XLlT) for demo.

### To play around with it...
There are 3 sliders provided. Move them to see how the movements of the flock changes.

#### First Slider 
It  is for Alignment, which moves a boid towards average heading of surrounding boids.

#### Second Slider 
It is for Cohesion, which moves every boid towards average position of surrounding boids.

#### Third Slider 
It is for Seperation, which moves every boid away from surrounding boid to avoid Crowding.

This has been inspired from the works of [Daiel Shiffman].
